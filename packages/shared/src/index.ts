// @kindy/shared — the pure, DOM-free, Node-free document core shared by the editor
// frontend and the collaboration backend. Everything here is plain data + logic:
// the document model, positions, the operation log (applyOp), and the text
// helpers. No canvas, no DOM, no Node APIs — so both the browser editor and the
// server can import and run it (replay, transform, serialize).
