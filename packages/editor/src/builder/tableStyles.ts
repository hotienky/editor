// Builder-only table-style presets. These are NOT a model concept — they are
// resolved into concrete cell formatting (shading, borders, run/para styles) at
// build time, so nothing style-id-like ever lands in the Document. A preset is the
// BASE; an explicit CellSpec value always wins (applied in TableBuilder.toBlock).
//
// Lives in its own module (no BuilderContext import) so both blockFactory.ts (which
// seeds the per-builder registry) and tableBuilder.ts (which applies presets) can
// import it without a runtime cycle.
